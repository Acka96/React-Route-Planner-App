The route planner application is designed so that the user can enter the starting and ending point of their trip, assuming that they will use a car as a means of transportation. The application uses the Google map API, so the map uses real-time data. The user is also allowed to add as many stations as he needs.
React is used to create the app and Tailwind CSS is used for styling.

To be able to use Google MAP API you need to Create API in google console for developers https://console.developers.google.com, and make sure to enable billing for Google project. Also, you need to download Maps JavaScript API and then allow Direction API, and Places API, because they are used.

To start the application, you need to enter the command npm install in the terminal, then to enter the application use the command cd app-name, and finally npm start. Tailwind CSS installation commands can be found here https://tailvindcss.com/docs/installation.
